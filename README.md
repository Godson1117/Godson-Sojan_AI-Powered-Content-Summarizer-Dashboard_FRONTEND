#### Project Setup

1. To install the necessary packages execute `npm install`.
2. To run the frontend use the command `npm run dev`.
2. For the web scraping functionality an API is created.To run the backend goto `/Api` and execute the commands `npm install` and `node index` respectively.


*The Api is functioning as alone,but some cors error occures when accessing from the frontend.Therefore,the scrapping functionality doesn't working.All other requirements are satisfied*
